Note some versions may not run because of errors but it should be fixed in the next version 

Each version is the progress that I made in the 1 hour to an hour and a half

Some version progress may be less than others that is because of bug fixes and optimisation.

All made in Visual Studio 2017 Community but dow work in Visual Studio 2019 Community as of 16/9/2019
